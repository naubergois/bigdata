    " - Efficient PCA implementation, Randomized PCA, online PCA\n",
    " - Unsupervised learning in real tasks\n",
    " - Word2Vec applied to sequential data (even website sessions like in the \"Alice\" competition)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SGD & Vowpal Wabbit\n",
    " - Something that better covers the course material, e.g. a broader review of Vowpal Wabbit \n",
    " - Matrix factorization, FMs and Vowpal Wabbit implementation\n",
